## What are cloud native buildpacks?

Cloud native buildpacks are a technology for building and packaging applications in cloud environments. They provide a standard way to package an application and its dependencies, making it easier to run the application in any cloud environment.

Buildpacks are a cloud-native way of automating the process of packaging applications, as opposed to traditional packaging methods that involve manual configuration. With buildpacks, the packaging process is automated, reducing the amount of time and effort required to get an application up and running.

Buildpacks are specifically designed for cloud native environments, making it easier to run applications in a cloud environment. They provide a standard way to package an application and its dependencies, so that the application can run in any cloud environment. This makes it easier to move applications between different cloud environments, as well as making it easier to deploy and manage applications in the cloud.

Overall, cloud native buildpacks are a technology that makes it easier to build, package, and deploy applications in cloud environments, providing a standard way to package applications and their dependencies.

## Make a tutorial with specific tools, commands, and examples

Here's a tutorial on how to use cloud native buildpacks with specific tools, commands, and examples:

1. Install the Cloud Native Buildpack CLI (cnb)

The first step is to install the Cloud Native Buildpack CLI (cnb). You can do this using the following command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildpacks/pack/master/install.sh | bash
```

2. Create a new directory for your application

Create a new directory for your application and navigate to it. For this tutorial, let's call it "myapp".

```bash
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
```

3. Write a simple web application

For this tutorial, let's write a simple web application in Python. Create a file called app.py with the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

4. Create a requirements.txt file

Create a requirements.txt file with the following contents:

```
flask
```

This file lists the dependencies that the application needs to run. In this case, it is just the Flask library.

5. Package the application using cnb

Now that we have written the application and listed its dependencies, we can package it using the cnb CLI. Run the following command:

```bash
pack build myimage -b python_buildpack
```

This will build the application and package it into a Docker image. The -b flag specifies the buildpack to use. In this case, we are using the Python buildpack. The resulting image will be named myimage.

6. Run the packaged application

Now that we have packaged the application, we can run it using the following command:

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 myimage
```

This will start a Docker container with the application running inside. The -p flag maps port 5000 in the container to port 5000 on the host.

7. Test the application

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser.

This is a basic example of how to use cloud native buildpacks to package a simple web application. The buildpack CLI provides many more options and features for building and packaging more complex applications.
